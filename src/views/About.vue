    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>This is a code test in Vue.js, Vuex and tested with mocha and chai.</p>
    <p>It was written using TDD, and should contain tests for all parts of all components.</p>
    <p>It has these assumptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chart.js has been thoroughly tested, so does not need additional testing</li>
      <li>The data from the json file is always correct</li>
      <li>Data does not need to persist between reloads</li>
      <li>There is a global stylesheet that would apply to everything here, it is a
        demonstration of Vue, not of CSS</li>
    </ul>
